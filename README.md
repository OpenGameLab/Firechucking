This is just a dumb little project to help me re-learn what I'd forgotten about Godot 3.5, and learn more about Godot 4.2

It has a simple premise :  Player runs around and gets chassed by Npc(s) or other players.  They attack and destroy the tiles under their feet. The tiles regenerate, and if a player/npc is stuck in the tile when the regeneration happens, they die.
